If you are a Linux <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/linux>
user, or a webmaster managing your own website (which is probably hosted
on a Linux <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/linux> server), you
will surely come across a situation when you try to upload a file or
modify a document and receive the error “/You do not have the
permissions to upload file to the folder/“. And after some googling, the
solution is often as easy as setting the file permission to “775” or
“777”. So what exactly does “777” mean? And why must it be ‘7’, and not
‘8’ or ‘9’?

    Understanding File Permissions

Unix systems (including Linux
<https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/linux> and Mac OS X) come with
a file control mechanism to determine who can access a particular file
or folder and what actions they can do to it. There are two parts
<https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/parts> to the file control
mechanism, namely /Classes/ and /Permissions/. *Classes* determines who
can access the file while the *Permissions* determines the kind of
action the user can do to the file.

There are three Classes – Owner, Group, Others.

  * The Owner is the usually the creator of the files/folders. In Linux
    <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/linux>, files or folders
    that you created in your Home directory are usually /owned/ by you,
    unless you specifically change the ownership.
  * The Group contains a group of users who share the same permissions
    and user privilege.
  * Others means the general public.

file-permissions-classes

As for permissions, there are 3 type of actions that you can perform on
a file/folder. You can either /read/, /write/ or /execute/.

  * *Read* – You can only view the file, but cannot modify the content
    of the file. When applied on Folder, you can only view the files in
    the folder, but you can’t delete from or add files into the folder.
  * *Write* – You can edit and modify the file. For Folders, you can
    delete and add files into the folder.
  * *Execute* – Execute is mainly used when you need to run the file
    (commonly used when you need to run a script).

file-permissions-permissions

When you combine the Classes and the Permissions, you will be able to
control who can access the file and what actions they are able to do
with it.

For example, the owner will usually have all the permissions (read,
write and execute) to access the file. If you are not the owner of the
file/folder, you have to change the Ownership of the file to your name,
or change the permissions of Group or Others to read, write or execute.
In a web server <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/server>, if
you are not able to upload a file, it is probably because you are not
the owner of the destination folder, or you are not given sufficient
permissions to add files to the folder.


    What’s about the number?

With the basic understanding of the Classes and Permissions, let’s delve
into it further and see how the “777” or “775” come about.

Every file and folder contain a 8-bit data
<https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/data> that control the
permissions. At its basic binary
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system> form, it will be
“000”, which means no permissions of any form is granted. When you set a
“Read” permission, it will add 4-bit to the data
<https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/data>, making it “100” (in
binary format) or a “4” in the usual decimal
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal> format. Setting a “Write”
permission will add 2-bit to the data, making it “010” and “2” in
decimal form. Lastly, setting an “Execute” permission adds 1-bit to the
data, which will result in “001”, or “1” in decimal form. In short:

  * Read is equivalent to ‘4’.
  * Write is equivalent to ‘2’.
  * Execute is equivalent to ‘1’

When we want to set permissions, we just add up the number. For example,
to set the permissions to read and write, we will use ‘6’ (4 + 2) for
the permission. For read, write and execute, we will use ‘7’ (4 + 2 + 1)
for the permission. Here’s the different permutation:

0 – no permission
1 – execute
2 – write
3 – write and execute
4 – read
5 – read and execute
6 – read and write
7 – read, write, and execute

Depending on the permissions you want to grant to the file, you just set
the number accordingly.

What about the 3 digits ‘777’? Well, the first digit is assigned to the
Owner, the second digit is assigned to the Group and the third digit is
assigned to the Others. So for a file with ‘777’ permission, everyone
can read, write and execute the file. Here are some of the commonly used
permissions:

  * 755 – This set of permission is commonly used in web server
    <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/server>. The owner has all
    the permissions to read, write and execute. Everyone else can only
    read and execute, but cannot make changes to the file.
  * 777 – Everyone can read write and execute. In a web server, it is
    not advisable to set ‘777’ permission for your files and folders as
    it allows anyone to add malicious code to your server. However, in
    some cases <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/cases>, you
    will need to set the 777 permissions before you can upload any file
    to the server (For example, uploading images in WordPress)
  * 644 – Only the owner can read and write. Everyone else can only
    read. No one can execute the file.
  * 655 – Only the owner can read and write, but not execute the file.
    Everyone else can read and execute, but cannot modify the file.


    Setting File Permissions in Command Line

In Linux <https://www.buydig.com/shop/list/keyword/linux>, you can
easily change the file permissions by right-clicking the file or folder
and select “Properties”. There will be a Permission tab where you can
change the file permissions
<https://www.amazon.com/File-permissions-ownership-explained-pt-2/dp/B01L80CLHK>.
In the terminal, the command to use to change file permission is
“|chmod|“. In short, “chmod 777” means making the file readable,
writable and executable by everyone.

chmod 775 /path/to/file

Hopefully, this article can help you understand better about the file
permissions in Unix system and the origin of the magical number “777”.

    or you can use the mnemonics

    chmod u+x g+rw o+r filename

    u – user
    g – group
    o – other (world)

    r – read
    w- write
    x – execute

    Much easier to remember

    David Dreggors says

    and conversely the umask is the “negative” approach to the same.

    For instance with umask you start with a theoretical 777
    (rwxrwxrwx). When you apply a umask you “remove” the umask from the
    777 permissions.

    Consider the following umasks and the permissions they will give to
    newly created files…

    022 = 755
    002 = 775
    000 = 777

    or written in a more obvious light:

    777 – 022 = 755
    777 – 002 = 775
    777 – 000 = 777

    Hope that is useful as well. :-)

    Tim says

    You forgot to mention how “execute” permission applies to folders.
    In order to actually view the contents of the folder, you need to
    have “5” permission, because the execute allows you to open the
    folder, and the read allows you to view the files inside it.

    Thanks for a clear indtroduction to Linux file permissions. Writing
    correct English is also important, as in ‘what does something mean’
    (not ‘means’). Also, it is ‘chmod’ (never ‘Chmod’).

    Hi I’m working on a wordpress site and sometimes the plugins need to
    write to the files. But I noticed that for some hosts, 644
    permission is enough whereas for some other hosts, 777 is required
    for the same writing function. Anyone has any idea why?

        Damien says

        The differences is the file ownership. In some web host, you are
        set as the
        file owner and all the files under your public folder are under
        your name,
        so a 644 permission is enough to perform a read/write. For some
        web host,
        they are using a generic “www-data” as the file owner. As such,
        you will
        have to change the permission to 777 before you can write to it.
