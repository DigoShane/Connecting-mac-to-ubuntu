This is instructions for Run-1.
The code being used is GinzburgLandau-1D-Constraint2.py
where the output of solve is replaced by u_+=\max\{u,0\} or |u|.
We thus have to control the plot at each stage with small step size and tolerance change.
Note that there are two files in this directory the one corresponding to u_+ titled up and the other corresponding to |u| titled ua.

To run the code
1. Copy this into the directory XDMF_Restart. 
2. Uncomment the reading of initial condition from xdmf file part.
3. Change the name of the file to be read in, would have to change the number.
4. The length of the domain should be Lx=100 and kappa=1. 
5. Run the code and input the following
   H=0.707
   rlx_par=0.0001 
   tol_abs=0.00001
