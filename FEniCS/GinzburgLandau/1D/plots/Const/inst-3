This is instructions for Run-1.
1. Copy this into the directory XDMF_Restart. 
2. Uncomment the reading of initial condition from xdmf file part.
3. Change the name of the file to be read in, would have to change the number.
4. The length of the domain should be Lx=100 and kappa=1. 
5. Run the code and input the following
   H=0.707
   rlx_par=0.0001 
   tol_abs=0.00001

This one is a bit tricky cause it took a long time to run. More ofte than note, I had to use 0.00001-0.0000001 as the relaxation parameter.
