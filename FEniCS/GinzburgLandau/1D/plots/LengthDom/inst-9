This is instructions for Run.
1. Copy this into the directory XDMF_Restart. 
2. Uncomment the reading of initial condition from xdmf file part.
3. Change the name of the file to be read in;you would have to change the number.
4. The length of the domain should be Lx=300 and N=3000 discretization and kappa=1. 
5. Run the code and input the following
   H=1
   rlx_par=0.1 (1 gives different/sharper result)
   tol_abs=0.000001

Once the figure is plotted, you can manipulate everything.

This one was hard since we ended up oscillating a lot. I think this has to do with the length of the domain.
